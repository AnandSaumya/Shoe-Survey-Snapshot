As a part of the coursework for Business Experimentation and Causal Methods, my team and I worked on a project that delved into AB testing and user preferences. We tried to understand the possibility of a causal problem focused on customer preferences and brand visibility. 
The data points for this project were collected by us by circulating two surveys amongst people in the age group of 18-30 years. Each group, comprising 60 participants, received identical survey questions. The treatment group viewed images of five shoes featuring a brand logo, while the control group viewed the same shoe images without the brand logo.

## $\textbf{Research Question:}$
This project explores the influence of brand logos on consumer decision-making. The problem we are trying to investigate focuses on whether the presence of a well-known logo affects participants' choices, even when shoe characteristics are identical. By isolating brand popularity from shoe qualities, we aim to gain insights into consumer psychology and brand appeal.

## $\textbf{Business Relevance:}$
This project can help understand how brands influence the purchasing patterns of customers. The analysis can be used to ascertain the placement and structuring of a brand logo on the shoe thereby helping improve customer's preference and experience.
